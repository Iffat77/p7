# <strong> [Project 7](https://6265accce9167a6fca0dc4b0--aquamarine-belekoy-ebf984.netlify.app/)</strong>


# Project Overview

- Here I created a site populated with information from an API that proves covid test results

## Thought Process

- Using the 8 patients in the api I populated the page with their name and age and weather they were positive for covid19 or negative.

### MVP
- Page runs without errors
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Surge
- Includes a README written in well formatted Markdown (hint: look up a README template)
- Shows a good commit history with frequent commits. We're looking for lots of small commits.
